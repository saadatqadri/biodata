Summary: List of Django learning resources

Inspired by [Eddy Chan's list](http://eddychan.com/post/15775730174/how-i-learnt-enough-python-django-to-be-dangerous-in-1), I wanted to put together a list of Django resources that I used to learn the framework, and continue to reference today.

## Beginner

[Django Book](http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/) - outdated now, needs to be rewritten for Django 1.6

[Django By Example](http://lightbird.net/dbe/) - also needs updating, but a good selection of projects to try out

## Moderate 

[Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/) - full example, written in Django 1.5, easy to follow, brilliant. One of the best tutorials out there.

[Effective Django Tutorial](http://effectivedjango.com/tutorial/) - written by an EventBrite engineer, love the section on Class-based Views

## Advanced

[AngularJS and Django](http://glynjackson.org/weblog/entry/django-angular.html)
