Summary: Basic setup for GitHub Pages and Pelican

I started writing a blog earlier this year, with the intention of capturing my ideas and *fleeting* thoughts. I initially started a Tumblr blog, wasn't too happy with the themes available for free, and then switched over to [Svbtle](svbtle.com), a new, minimalist writing platform by Dustin Curtis. I was really excited about the minimalist feel of Svbtle at first, and some of the people I'm following (Nima Gardideh (Frank & Oak)) maintained a Svbtle blog. However, the lack of certain features - adding Disqus comments, and the ability to modify the base Svbtle theme was a bit limiting. I wanted people to comment on my articles. I wanted to elicit discussion. 

Long story short - I moved my content from Svbtle to Medium, and I started looking at options for hosting a "landing page" for myself. I played around with Ghost and Wordpress, but I just wanted a simple way to get my content online. After a bit of research, GitHub Pages was what I was looking for. 

I followed directions on these three articles to get my Pelican blog running on GitHub pages:

* [Pelican and GitHub Pages](http://martinbrochhaus.com/pelican2.html)
* [How I Set Up Pelican](http://terriyu.info/blog/posts/2013/07/pelican-setup/)
* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)

** More details soon.
